It would remain near the top of charts for over a year and a half. As Taco Bell saw decreasing demand, they made the decision in May 2011 to remove it from their menu, according to their Facebook page.\n\nAfter pressure from several revival movements, Taco Bell returned the burrito to its menu in late 2011, only to see it removed again in early 2012.\n\nFrom here, the Beefy Crunch Burrito began to see a \"McRib effect\", being released and discontinued with no real pattern. On May 23, 2013, the Burrito saw a return, only to be removed later that year.\n\nFor almost three years, the burrito remained in seclusion, until it was announced in March 2016 for another limited-time promotion. This time, it was to be a 6-week run, and as the time was coming for it's removal, Taco Bell posted a picture to their Instagram page. If it received 50,000 likes, the Beefy Crunch would stay another 6 weeks. With ease, the picture surpassed this milestone, and as of June 8th, 2016, the burrito was still available.\n\nA similar burrito, the Beefy Fritos Burrito, had appeared on the Dollar Cravings menu in its place. Fans of the Beefy Crunch Burrito rejected this burrito, citing that it is only similar in appearance, and not flavors. The Beefy Fritos Burrito was discontinued in 2020.[1] \n\nBeefy Crunch Movement logo.\nThe success of the Beefy Crunch Burrito is largely thanks to the Beefy Crunch movement, a fan-run Facebook page with nearly 70,000 followers. Since May 2011, they've lobbied for the return of the burrito, with plenty of successes, especially in 2016. Nothing about 2017 and Beyond.\n\nMost recently, followers of the movement even took a trip to Taco Bell HQ, as seen on their Facebook page."

Take Taco Bell’s new Beefy Potato-rito for example. This new $1* blockbuster is filled with those seasoned, crispy potato bites we all love. And let us not forget the great supporting roles of the melted, real cheddar cheese, creamy chipotle sauce and nacho cheese sauce. It’s obvious that it’s the combined powers of all these ingredients that makes this burrito truly amazing, not just the Seasoned Beef. Which is fine.

Disgruntled fans of the Beefer held restaurant sit-ins known as “Stank Festivals”, a commentary on Taco Bell's reputation, in protest after its cancellation. Originally created by executives John “Johnny” C. Hoba  and Douglas “Doug” O. Hoba to combat items offered at hamburger chains, the Bell Beefer was a bun with meat, diced onions, shredded lettuce and mild border sauce. A Bell Beefer Supreme was also offered, which added diced tomatoes and grated cheese. A few select restaurants offered the Bell Beefer Surf and Turf Deluxe, which added fried shrimp and a scoop of tuna on top of the Beefer's lettuce, as well as a line of Taco Tartar Sauce. More like a Sloppy Joe than a hamburger, it was well-liked early on, but declined in popularity during the late 1980s. It had a resurgence in popularity in the early 2010s, although that was only for a short while. John Cena recently has claimed that he is very upset they ever discontinued this item off of the Taco Bell menu."

    "img": "IMG_0084.jpg",
    "detail": "Lava Sauce was a spicy nacho cheese sauce that added a fiery kick to Taco Bell's menu offerings for several years. It was first introduced in 2008 as part of the Volcano Taco, which quickly became a fan favorite thanks in part to the bold flavor of the Lava Sauce. Following the success of the Volcano Taco, Lava Sauce was also included in other popular menu items such as the Volcano Nachos and the Volcano Double Beef Burrito.\n\nFor several years, Lava Sauce remained a popular choice among Taco Bell customers who appreciated its unique combination of spice and cheese. However, the sauce was eventually discontinued in 2013, much to the disappointment of many fans. The reasons for the discontinuation of Lava Sauce are not entirely clear, but it is possible that the sauce's intense spiciness may have made it less appealing to some customers.\n\nDespite its discontinuation, Lava Sauce made a brief return to Taco Bell's menu in September 2015 as part of the Volcano Quesarito and Steak Burrito. The limited-time offering was a hit with fans, many of whom had been eagerly awaiting the return of the spicy nacho cheese sauce. While Lava Sauce may no longer be a regular menu item at Taco Bell, its legacy lives on among fans who continue to reminisce about the bold and flavorful sauce.\n\nLava sauce was temporarily brought back on June 29th 2023 (June 27th 2023 for Taco Bell Rewards Members) along with the Volcano Taco and the Volcano Double Beef Burrito.\n\nLava Sauce dates its origins back to June 1995, with its introduction in the Volcano Taco as a Congo tie in. Users across the country praised its roll-out, design, and flavor. In May 2009, the Volcano Menu expanded to include the Volcano Burrito and the Volcano Nachos, which incorporated Lava sauce and generated even more praise for the company.\n\nLava Sauce was a strong selling point for the Volcano Menu, and with the passage of time came a decrease in sales. Among the reasons was a leaning-away from fast food in general.\n\nAfter 5 years of stardom, much to the disappointment of many Taco Bell enthusiasts, Lava Sauce came to an end in September 2013. Several social media campaigns to bring it back were launched soon after the decision was made.\n\nOn September 23, 2015, Taco Bell announced the return of Lava Sauce in a tweet, which read:\n\nYou asked for it. Lava Sauce is back. Get it on the volcano taco tomorrow!\nThe spicy nacho cheese sauce had been a popular item in previous years and many fans had been asking for its return. To the delight of fans, Lava Sauce was brought back and was immediately available on the Volcano Taco.\n\nIn addition to the Volcano Taco, customers were able to add Lava Sauce to any menu item they desired. The sauce was made available in small plastic trays, making it easy for customers to dip their favorite Taco Bell items in the bold and flavorful sauce.\n\nThe return of Lava Sauce was met with great enthusiasm from fans, many of whom had been eagerly anticipating its comeback. Some fans even took to social media to share their excitement about the sauce's return and to express their appreciation for Taco Bell's decision to bring it back.\n\nWhile Lava Sauce is no longer a regular menu item at Taco Bell, the excitement generated by its brief return in 2015 is a testament to the sauce's enduring popularity among fans.\n\nOn March 16th, 2023, Taco Bell announced that they would be bringing back their popular Volcano Menu, complete with the fan-favorite Lava Sauce. The original Volcano Menu, launched in 2008, included items like the Volcano Taco, Volcano Burrito, and Volcano Nachos, all of which were known for their spicy flavors and Lava Sauce, a blend of cheese, sour cream, and fiery jalapenos. \n\n\nIt is worth noting that Lava Sauce has made an appearance in some form in Taco Bell's international markets. In the United Kingdom, for example, Taco Bell offers a tomato-based sauce that is also known as Lava Sauce. This sauce has a similar consistency and spiciness to the original Lava Sauce, but is more akin to a salsa in terms of flavor and texture. While this may not be the same Lava Sauce that fans remember from the past, it does offer a taste of the spicy sauce that many fans have been missing."

    "detail": "Lettuce is a leafy green vegetable that is a common ingredient in many Taco Bell items, providing both texture and volume to the dish. In most Taco Bell locations, the specific type of lettuce used is shredded iceberg lettuce, which is known for its mild taste and crisp texture.\n\nDespite being a low-calorie and low-fat ingredient, lettuce is still a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. However, it has a relatively low nutritional density compared to other vegetables and is often used more as a filler or garnish than as a primary source of nutrients.\n\nBecause of its low calorie and high fiber content, lettuce is considered one of the healthiest items served at Taco Bell. It can help fill you up without adding too many calories to your meal, making it a great option for those looking to maintain a healthy diet while enjoying fast food.\n\nTaco Bell once featured two different types of lettuce in its menu items: romaine lettuce and iceberg lettuce. Romaine lettuce, with its darker color and more pronounced flavor, was a popular option for those looking for a slightly more robust taste in their dishes. \n\nHowever, in an effort to streamline its menu and focus on its most popular items, Taco Bell made the decision to indefinitely remove romaine lettuce from its offerings. This decision was likely driven by a desire to simplify operations and reduce waste by limiting the number of ingredients used in its dishes.\n\nDespite the removal of romaine lettuce, Taco Bell still offers its customers the same crisp and crunchy texture of iceberg lettuce, which is a staple in many of its menu items. While the absence of romaine lettuce may be disappointing for some, Taco Bell's continued commitment to providing fresh and tasty ingredients ensures that there are still plenty of delicious options to choose from."

After then, they were brought back every year since numerous times during various LTO periods (usually in January and/or July).\n\n\"You know that wine guy at the swanky restaurant downtown?\n\nDressed in a silky tie and formal coat. It’s his job to not only know his vino, but to pair them with other items on the menu. Items which alone may actually be tasty, but somehow need a little something else to make them complete. Which leads us to the question… What happens when you already have a perfect pairing …without the wine?\n\nTake Taco Bell’s new Nacho Fries for instance. Some people have recently been overheard to say, “While sinfully delicious, they are a match made in heaven”. That’s because, unlike all those other fries you’ve had over the years, these new Nacho Fries are amazingly crispy and boldly seasoned with Mexican spices. Think of them as an exciting step-up in the world of fries. They are truly unique. Which is why Taco Bell pairs them up with their classic warm Nacho Cheese Sauce for dipping. They just go together. Regular old ketchup just wouldn’t do here (no offense to our friends who make ketchup).\n\nYou see, the Nacho Cheese Sauce perfectly complements these one of kind fries in a way that no other dip could. It’s like these two were meant for each other. Call it destiny if you like. Or maybe just call it by its name to avoid any confusion.\n\nSpeaking of confusion… Let’s get back to our friend the wine guy. He spent years of his life studying to be a Sommelier. And though he knows his wines better than he knows his own mother, he would no doubt be hard pressed to find a single bottle down in the cellar which could pair up with these new Nacho Fries. Especially since his fancy pants restaurant doesn’t actually serve Nacho Fries. You can only get them at your local participating Taco Bell® location. Which doesn’t serve wine.\""

In 1970, the soft taco was released, and became the best-selling menu item of any fast food restaurant for all of 1970 and 1971.\n\nThe taco has since undergone many changes and upgrades, from the Taco Lite of the 1980s, to the Doritos Locos Tacos of today. Tacos are available in many different varieties, including chicken, steak, and beef.

The taco consisted of an extra long white flour tortilla shell filled with double the meat (when compared to normal tacos), along with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and cheddar cheese.\n\nThe shell was the same kind of shell still used as the bowl for the Taco Salad (light and flaky). The shell, when bitten into, would never splinter down the taco, or cause the entire shell to fail as a normal shell will sometimes do. Instead it would leave an outline of exactly where the bite took place.\n\nIt was on the menu for quite a few years. The running theory as to why the item was discontinued is in the name \"light\". The majority of customers saw this menu item as some sort of \"diet taco\", when in reality, it was very high in calories, due in part to its large size. Customers did not go to Taco Bell to eat a diet taco, so sales were poor.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nSeveral social media outlets have groups requesting the return of the Taco Light. Official word has been given as of October 2020."

Disgruntled fans of the Beefer held restaurant sit-ins known as “Stank Festivals”, a commentary on Taco Bell's reputation, in protest after its cancellation. Originally created by executives John “Johnny” C. Hoba  and Douglas “Doug” O. Hoba to combat items offered at hamburger chains, the Bell Beefer was a bun with meat, diced onions, shredded lettuce and mild border sauce. A Bell Beefer Supreme was also offered, which added diced tomatoes and grated cheese. A few select restaurants offered the Bell Beefer Surf and Turf Deluxe, which added fried shrimp and a scoop of tuna on top of the Beefer's lettuce, as well as a line of Taco Tartar Sauce. More like a Sloppy Joe than a hamburger, it was well-liked early on, but declined in popularity during the late 1980s. It had a resurgence in popularity in the early 2010s, although that was only for a short while.

The Beefy Fritos Burrito was discontinued in 2020.[1] \n\nBeefy Crunch Movement logo.\nThe success of the Beefy Crunch Burrito is largely thanks to the Beefy Crunch movement, a fan-run Facebook page with nearly 70,000 followers. Since May 2011, they've lobbied for the return of the burrito, with plenty of successes, especially in 2016. Nothing about 2017 and Beyond.\n\nMost recently, followers of the movement even took a trip to Taco Bell HQ, as seen on their Facebook page."

Seasoned Beef and Potatoes are like the dynamic duo of the culinary universe. But hold on a sec! How come Potato is NEVER in the spotlight? It’s like Seasoned Beef is ALWAYS stealing the scene. Take Taco Bell’s new Beefy Potato-rito for example. This new $1* blockbuster is filled with those seasoned, crispy potato bites we all love. And let us not forget the great supporting roles of the melted, real cheddar cheese, creamy chipotle sauce and nacho cheese sauce. It’s obvious that it’s the combined powers of all these ingredients that makes this burrito truly amazing, not just the Seasoned Beef. Which is fine. Maybe one day Potato WILL star in his very own spin-off (without Seasoned Beef), but until then we can all look forward to their combined never ending battle to keep our budgets safe and cravings at bay.\""

    "img": "IMG_0084.jpg",
    "detail": "Lava Sauce was a spicy nacho cheese sauce that added a fiery kick to Taco Bell's menu offerings for several years. It was first introduced in 2008 as part of the Volcano Taco, which quickly became a fan favorite thanks in part to the bold flavor of the Lava Sauce. Following the success of the Volcano Taco, Lava Sauce was also included in other popular menu items such as the Volcano Nachos and the Volcano Double Beef Burrito.\n\nFor several years, Lava Sauce remained a popular choice among Taco Bell customers who appreciated its unique combination of spice and cheese. However, the sauce was eventually discontinued in 2013, much to the disappointment of many fans. The reasons for the discontinuation of Lava Sauce are not entirely clear, but it is possible that the sauce's intense spiciness may have made it less appealing to some customers.\n\nDespite its discontinuation, Lava Sauce made a brief return to Taco Bell's menu in September 2015 as part of the Volcano Quesarito and Steak Burrito. The limited-time offering was a hit with fans, many of whom had been eagerly awaiting the return of the spicy nacho cheese sauce. While Lava Sauce may no longer be a regular menu item at Taco Bell, its legacy lives on among fans who continue to reminisce about the bold and flavorful sauce.\n\nLava sauce was temporarily brought back on June 29th 2023 (June 27th 2023 for Taco Bell Rewards Members) along with the Volcano Taco and the Volcano Double Beef Burrito.\n\nLava Sauce dates its origins back to June 1995, with its introduction in the Volcano Taco as a Congo tie in. Users across the country praised its roll-out, design, and flavor. In May 2009, the Volcano Menu expanded to include the Volcano Burrito and the Volcano Nachos, which incorporated Lava sauce and generated even more praise for the company.\n\nLava Sauce was a strong selling point for the Volcano Menu, and with the passage of time came a decrease in sales. Among the reasons was a leaning-away from fast food in general.\n\nAfter 5 years of stardom, much to the disappointment of many Taco Bell enthusiasts, Lava Sauce came to an end in September 2013. Several social media campaigns to bring it back were launched soon after the decision was made.\n\nOn September 23, 2015, Taco Bell announced the return of Lava Sauce in a tweet, which read:\n\nYou asked for it. Lava Sauce is back. Get it on the volcano taco tomorrow!\nThe spicy nacho cheese sauce had been a popular item in previous years and many fans had been asking for its return. To the delight of fans, Lava Sauce was brought back and was immediately available on the Volcano Taco.\n\nIn addition to the Volcano Taco, customers were able to add Lava Sauce to any menu item they desired. The sauce was made available in small plastic trays, making it easy for customers to dip their favorite Taco Bell items in the bold and flavorful sauce.\n\nThe return of Lava Sauce was met with great enthusiasm from fans, many of whom had been eagerly anticipating its comeback. Some fans even took to social media to share their excitement about the sauce's return and to express their appreciation for Taco Bell's decision to bring it back.\n\nWhile Lava Sauce is no longer a regular menu item at Taco Bell, the excitement generated by its brief return in 2015 is a testament to the sauce's enduring popularity among fans.\n\nOn March 16th, 2023, Taco Bell announced that they would be bringing back their popular Volcano Menu, complete with the fan-favorite Lava Sauce. The original Volcano Menu, launched in 2008, included items like the Volcano Taco, Volcano Burrito, and Volcano Nachos, all of which were known for their spicy flavors and Lava Sauce, a blend of cheese, sour cream, and fiery jalapenos. \n\n\nIt is worth noting that Lava Sauce has made an appearance in some form in Taco Bell's international markets. In the United Kingdom, for example, Taco Bell offers a tomato-based sauce that is also known as Lava Sauce. This sauce has a similar consistency and spiciness to the original Lava Sauce, but is more akin to a salsa in terms of flavor and texture. While this may not be the same Lava Sauce that fans remember from the past, it does offer a taste of the spicy sauce that many fans have been missing."

    "detail": "Lettuce is a leafy green vegetable that is a common ingredient in many Taco Bell items, providing both texture and volume to the dish. In most Taco Bell locations, the specific type of lettuce used is shredded iceberg lettuce, which is known for its mild taste and crisp texture.\n\nDespite being a low-calorie and low-fat ingredient, lettuce is still a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. However, it has a relatively low nutritional density compared to other vegetables and is often used more as a filler or garnish than as a primary source of nutrients.\n\nBecause of its low calorie and high fiber content, lettuce is considered one of the healthiest items served at Taco Bell. It can help fill you up without adding too many calories to your meal, making it a great option for those looking to maintain a healthy diet while enjoying fast food.\n\nTaco Bell once featured two different types of lettuce in its menu items: romaine lettuce and iceberg lettuce. Romaine lettuce, with its darker color and more pronounced flavor, was a popular option for those looking for a slightly more robust taste in their dishes. \n\nHowever, in an effort to streamline its menu and focus on its most popular items, Taco Bell made the decision to indefinitely remove romaine lettuce from its offerings. This decision was likely driven by a desire to simplify operations and reduce waste by limiting the number of ingredients used in its dishes.\n\nDespite the removal of romaine lettuce, Taco Bell still offers its customers the same crisp and crunchy texture of iceberg lettuce, which is a staple in many of its menu items. While the absence of romaine lettuce may be disappointing for some, Taco Bell's continued commitment to providing fresh and tasty ingredients ensures that there are still plenty of delicious options to choose from."

The shell, when bitten into, would never splinter down the taco, or cause the entire shell to fail as a normal shell will sometimes do. Instead it would leave an outline of exactly where the bite took place.\n\nIt was on the menu for quite a few years. The running theory as to why the item was discontinued is in the name \"light\". The majority of customers saw this menu item as some sort of \"diet taco\", when in reality, it was very high in calories, due in part to its large size. Customers did not go to Taco Bell to eat a diet taco, so sales were poor.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nSeveral social media outlets have groups requesting the return of the Taco Light.

In most Taco Bell locations, the specific type of lettuce used is shredded iceberg lettuce, which is known for its mild taste and crisp texture.\n\nDespite being a low-calorie and low-fat ingredient, lettuce is still a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. However, it has a relatively low nutritional density compared to other vegetables and is often used more as a filler or garnish than as a primary source of nutrients.\n\nBecause of its low calorie and high fiber content, lettuce is considered one of the healthiest items served at Taco Bell. It can help fill you up without adding too many calories to your meal, making it a great option for those looking to maintain a healthy diet while enjoying fast food.\n\nTaco Bell once featured two different types of lettuce in its menu items: romaine lettuce and iceberg lettuce. Romaine lettuce, with its darker color and more pronounced flavor, was a popular option for those looking for a slightly more robust taste in their dishes. \n\nHowever, in an effort to streamline its menu and focus on its most popular items, Taco Bell made the decision to indefinitely remove romaine lettuce from its offerings. This decision was likely driven by a desire to simplify operations and reduce waste by limiting the number of ingredients used in its dishes.\n\nDespite the removal of romaine lettuce, Taco Bell still offers its customers the same crisp and crunchy texture of iceberg lettuce, which is a staple in many of its menu items. While the absence of romaine lettuce may be disappointing for some, Taco Bell's continued commitment to providing fresh and tasty ingredients ensures that there are still plenty of delicious options to choose from."
